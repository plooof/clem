# Theme 1: What do I Really Believe
## What is God’s Plan for You?
- God has a plan for all of us.
- His plan is for us to love him, to love others, to be joyful in this life and joyful in the next.
- Although God always has a plan with us, he created us with free will.

## I Believe! My Personal Creed
> *I believe that God is always with me.
I believe that God has a plan for me.
I believe that God actively guides through a path of lightness.
I believe that I was created equally in the likeness of God.
I believe that although I may sometimes drift from the path of God, he will always guide me and accept me for who I am.*

## Reading Q &A
### Why is it impossible to prove God’s existence scientifically?
It's impossible to prove God' existance because there are next to no physical traces of God. The only physical trace of God is Jesus who roamed the Earth 2000 years ago.

### What is the only “proof” that we can have of God’s existence?
The only proof we would be able to have is through miracles that can't be explained by science or the fact that Jesus roamed the Earth. 

## Reflection
### Think about your own life. What is a dying or rising that you have experienced  - today, this week, this year, or in the past few years (perhaps during the pandemic)? In a reflection of 125 - 175 words), describe that experience making reference (or comparisons)  to the events of Jesus Christ’s passion, death, Resurrection, and Ascension.

*this part you have to fill out with your own thing*

## A Healthy Relationship with God
### How do you think we can keep our relationship with God healthy?
- Actively praying
- Going to church
- Doing good deeds
- Reading the bible (or relevant scripture)
- Being active in the church community

## What is Prayer?
### Notes
- prayer is the best way of acting out a relationship with God
- prayer is being humble, trusting God and opening up to God.
- you have to trust in your hopes, prayers, petitions and desires.
- there are 2 types of prayer:  public and personal prayer.
- partaking in the eucharist is the perfect prayer.
- church is being gathered in prayer.
- sacraments are major types of prayer.
- praying the rosary and performing devotions to saints are also major types of prayer.
- prayer can be thanking the Lord for his graces.
- if we don't pray to God, we grow distant from God.
- praying intesifies your relationship with God.

# Theme 2: What’s the Point of Prayer?
## The Five Forms of Prayer
### Adoration and Blessing

We learn from these passages that creating prayers of this type includes praising God and Jesus for who they are in our lives and what they have done for us as individuals and what they have done for us as a human race. By praying these types of prayers, it brings us closer to God by allowing us to realize truly what God has done for us. We also have to thank him so that he can continuously guide us as we go on with our lives.

### Petition

We learn from these passages that prayers of the petition sort incude communicating to God certain favours and need that we request. By praying these prayers, it improves our relationship with God because we are acknowledging that he is there and that we are asking him to help us as he can see all, do all and since he knows all.

### Intercession

We learn that in these passages they talk to God indirectly. Whether it be through Jesus or another person, they still spoke to them indirectly. By praying intercessional prayers, we acknowledge that not only God is present, but also that also the person or spirit that we are praying to is present. Whether it be Mary or Joseph, or St. Augustine or St. Faustina, we recognize that their presence is there with us and helping us with our intercessions.

### Thanksgiving

 In these passages, they thank God for various things for guiding them and being their God. It is important that we do so too to maintain a good relationship with God because by not doing so, it's basically like having someone do something for you but not thanking them. However, by thanking God, it shows that we truly do appreciate him for being with us, guiding us and helping us throughout our daily life.
 
 ### Praise
 
  In these passages, we truly acknowledge that God is our only God and that we praise him to the fullest of our humanly capabilities. It is important that we do so too to maintain a positive relationship with God because it just goes to show that we truly do appreciate and respect all that God has done for us and that God is our true, one and only God.
  
 ## God Will Provide
 ### God sometimes answers our prayers in ways that we don’t expect because God sees what we don’t always see.
 
 When the religious brother prayed for shelter when it started raining on the 5th day, although their initial destination (the inn) was unavailable to them, they later on found the cave which they used as shelter.
 
 ### Human freedom can sometimes prevent our prayers from being answered in ways that we expect.
 
 The non-religious brother didn't believe the prayers of the other brother thusforth he didn't trust God's process into keeping them safe and bringing them to shelter.
 
 ### Our expectations can blind us to God’s actions.
 
 The non-religious brother didn't expect any of what the religious brother was praying to be true and work out in their favour and because he was looking in the present and into what was happening at that very moment, he didn't think that maybe down the line, it would all work out for them.

 #Unit 5 Evaluation Task
 ---
### Dear Justin,

I see that you have not been doing too well lately. School has been quite the stressor lately huh? And all the stuff with your friends and family hasn't helped either. That's why I am writing to you. I just wanted to remind you to pray. There are so many reasons to pray. And it only takes a few minutes out of your day.

First off, it allows me to know that you still believe in me. I know that sometimes times get hard, but trust me, I'm here for you all the time. When your friends are too much and you just need someone to talk to, I'm right here, I've been here, and I will always be here.

Next, praying lets me know of the guidance and assistance you need from me. I can help you with almost anything. If you need help with friends and family, I can help you. Just come talk to me, and I'll help you the best way I can. The same thing goes with school, sports, etc. Praying lets me know that you need my help.

You don't even have to pray directly to me. There are so many other people that you can pray to. I mean, I can't do it alone. That's why you can pray to these other people like Mother Mary and Joseph, or St. Augustine or St Faustina. They can help you as much as I can. And they even specialize in certain things so they can help you with specific things.

Following, you can pray to thank me. Even though you and I haven't been talking much, I'm still trying to help you as much as I can. And by praying, you can thank me which lets me know that you appreciate what I do so that I can keep helping you. It helps me to do stuff for people when I know they appreciate it.

Lastly, you can pray to praise me. Similar to the last, it shows that you appreciate what I do. It shows that you respect me and you respect what I do. It's not easy out here. But by praising me, I can help you forever.

I know that praying is something that can be boring or seem like it doesn't help. But trust me, it does. It goes a long way when you can't seem to get that far. I want to help you, but I don't know if you want me to. Praying just lets me know that I should.

Love always,
God.

# Introduction
## Authority in Your Life
| Time of Life | Who has authority over you? | What authority fo you have? | Do you have authority over anyone? How much? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infant | Everyone | None | No one |
| Child | Basically everyone | Next to none other than my personal possessions | My sister : Next to none |
| Young Adult | Upperclassmen, teachers, adults, etc | Some over my possesions and helping around the house with major decisions | My sister : Some what greatly, my baby cousin : A great amount |
| Parent/Guardian | My parents, people older than me, people in a higher social position than me | A great deal | My children : Basically all, Younger relatives : Some what |
| Grandparent | My parents, people older than me, people in a higher social position than me | More than before | People younger than me : A lot, My decendants : A lot |

## Reflection Journal

I feel like it's very important to obey the members of my family. I feel this way because (especially if they are older) they have more life experience than you. If they are telling you something about what you should and shouldn't do, it's because they probably have seen a similar scenario before and have reflected on the scenario accordingly, allowing them to have a strong judgement on future situations. They also just know better. As you get older, you begin to see more things in depth. You look at the whole picture rather than just the thing in front of you. It's important to listen to their judgement because at the end of the day, they know what they are telling you. They've probably benn through it before.

I think the church would give me several suggestions. They would mention the fact that obeying your parents is stated in the 10 commandments. They would also state the fact that Jesus treated his parents very greatly and since we are all as Catholics trying to follow Jesus' footsteps, should do the same.

## The Fourth Commandment

I think that in this context, the word "honour" means to simply respect them. Treat them with the utmost respect and stay loyal to them. Help them out when they need help, etc. Never disrespect them and keep them above everyone else except God.

## "What Must I Do?"

| “Obedience is the discipline that keeps us from acting as if we were the centre of the universe. In obeying our parents and teachers we learn to share, co-operate and compromise.  Be demanding obedience and respect, they help us to understand that what we want isn’t always the most important thing.  As we obey and respect our parents and teachers, we become aware of the common good that must be part of our choices.”|
| --- |
| Rating: 3 |
| Explaination: I believe that while obedience does avoid us from becoming self-centered, there are many other factors that contribute to self-centeredness more than just obedience. Obedience simply shows that you respect figures of authority and their judgement. |
| Example: Your parents ask you to drop a friend who can recently got into some very bad habits. |

| “If you are really honest with yourself, you might see that obeying your parents often points you in the direction to become the best that you can be” |
| --- |
| Rating: 5 |
| Explaination: Your parents have lived longer than you have. Therefore, they know what's best for you and your future in most, if not all scenarios. |
| Example: Myself. I used to be extremely disobedient towards my parents and as a result, everything in my life also started to go negatively, however, I changed as a person and become obedient and everything has been smooth sailing ever since. |

| “The authority, stability and caring relationships within the family are the foundations for freedom, security and caring relationships in society.  As attitude of respect for authority is essential for society.  That attitude begins in the family.” |
| --- |
| Rating: 4 |
| Explaination: In many cases, a good majority of your time is spent with your family. Thus, those relationships will shape your "normal" in terms of relationships, etc. |
| Example: People in abusive households tend to be the same in future relationships. |

| “Obedience is not about doing exactly what someone tells you to do; it is about listening to those in authority and opening the door of your heart to recognize the good that may come from doing as they ask.  When your parents ask you to do something, you should listen to what they have asked, find the good in it, and do it unless it would be wrong.” |
| --- |
| Rating: 4 |
| Explaination: Obedience is about listening to people in authority who know better than you do and taking their advice because you value their opinions. |
| Example: Although a professional may say one thing, you know best what's good for yourself. |

## The Fourth Commandment in My Home

| Question | Answer | Ways to Improve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Here are three common answers I give to my parents when I am asked to do something: | In a bit, Wait, Sure what's up | Do things now rather than later. |
| How long do I argue with my parents about something that has been asked of me?  How long would it take to actually do this task? | Either no argument, 10 minutes, or about half an hour. | Do the task now rather than putting it off until later. |
| How often do I say, “Just a minute!” when I’m called?  How long is that “minute”?  How often do I repeat it? | Almost always. Twice or thrice. | Put whatever I'm doing on hold to attend to the situation. |
| How often do I pretend I can’t hear when I hear my parents calling me? | Next to never. | |
| How often do I resent my parents when they say, “We’re only asking you to do this for your own good”? | Never (they never say that) | |
| How often do I feel that my own needs and desires are at the bottom of the family’s priority list? | Extremely rarely |
| Has obeying my parents ever turned out badly? | Rare enough to where I can't name a specific occasion | |

## Q&A

### What reasons does the Bible give for obeying those in authority? 

For the Lord's sake. They also serve for the common good, and indirectly serve God.

### What makes an authority legitimate? 

When it is recognized by a population and serves the common good.

### Give an example of an illegitimate use of authority. (Base your answer on what the reading says about authorities that are not legitimate.) 

One that does not respect its weaker workers, promote good relationships and subjects.

### What is the relationship between obedience within society and obedience to God? 

When rules serve the common good in a positive manner, they indirectly serve God at the same time.

### What does it mean to accept co-responsibility with those in authority? 

It means to be aware of the actions of the authority and to challenge the authority when their actions no longer benefit the common good.

## Q&A

### What is the common good? 

Common good is what allows individuals and/or groups to reach their full potential.

### What conditions does the common good require? 

It requires that every individual be acknowledged and respected, and that it is built on a peaceful social order. 

### Give an example of one rule/policy in our society (or in your community or school) and explain why it does or does not serve the common good. 

My elementary school along Pharmacy, does not have a school zone. Since it is a straight major road, people typically speed along it. This can allow accidents to happen which can stop people from reaching their full potential.

### What is the magisterium? What is its job? 

The magisterium is a person in religious authority who gives a voice to the truths in our faith, name the behaviours for our faith to be preserved, observed and explained, to help people understand the demands of natural law and to remind people of what they should be before God.

### How does working for the common good benefit the individual?

The common body works like a body. If part of the body is sick, the rest of the body is affected. By treating that part of the body, the rest of the body starts to feel well as well.

#Unit 6 Evaluation Task

## Should Trevor have served the detention? Why or why not?

I feel that Trevor should have served the detention. When people are being punished for their actions, it is up to the plaintiff to decide whether or not certain individuals were part of the problem or not. In this case, the supply teacher felt that Trevor was part of the problem as was the rest of the class. Therefore, he should have served the detention as he was part of the problem, regardless of the directness of his part.

## When do you have a right to disobey and/or challenge school policies, discipline, or a law?

I feel like the disobedience of a policy, discipline or law should only be done when that said "rule" puts you or other people in a position of serious danger. I also feel that you have a right to disobey if there are conflicting rules.

## What would you have said to Trevor if you were Father Mike?

I would have said exactly what Father Mike said plus this. I would have pointed out that those rules are in place for a reason both for religious and lawful reasons. By getting married without a preparation course, once you get married you can be blind-sighted by all the changed that take place.

## How do you tell when a person has “crossed the line” and is challenging authority too much?

A person crosses the line when they are a repeat offender against several people. If a person crosses the line with just one person, it could just mean that they don't like that person. However, by crossing the line with several people, it really shows that you are actively trying to undermine authority.

# Theme 1: What keeps us apart?

### Seeing
Seeing involves recognizing that there is a decision at hand to be made and figuring out whether or not is moral. It also asks if the decision has to do with loving God, loving thyself or loving others. This stages also involves asking God to allow us to see with eyes of love.

### Judging
Judging calls us to look at all of the outcomes weighing which one has the best end result. Judging allows us to compare what we're learned from the Church and through scripture to different options, allowing us to choose what God would choose.

### Acting
Acting involves us finalizing our decision after careful consideration and consultation through scripture and church.

### Evaluating
Evaluating calls us to reflect on our decisions and the outcomes of it, with careful consideration as to how it has affected our relationship with God and the Church. It calls us to consider how we judge things and how we can improve our judgment in the future.

## The Good Samaritan

### This is a retelling of the story told in Luke 10:25-37.  When Jesus finishes telling the story, he tells his listeners to go and do what the Samaritan did.  What do you think that means?

Jesus wants us to go out into the world and help people in every way we can. If we see a person injured on a sidewalk, that we either treat them ourselves or call someone who can. Or if a person is asking for some change to get some food, that we help them out however we can. Whether that be by buying them food or giving them change is up to you. However, Jesus tell us that we should be helping the people who need it most.

### Who in this story was prejudiced?  How?

The 3 robbers were prejudiced. They classified the Jew as a person part of a group either racially or religiously who took land from the robbers' families. However, it's likely that the Jew in the story had nothing to do with that and that he was simply passing through.

### In what ways are compassion and prejudice opposites?

To my understanding, prejudice is something that happens before an event based on profiling whether that be racial, religious, sexual, etc. Compassion is something that takes place after where people try to understand the victim's situation to help them out and talk to them.

## Applying See, Judge, Act, or Evaluate

### See
<b> What is the injustice that you have chosen?</b>
I have chosen a sexist injustice.

<b> Who are the victims?</b>
The victim is woman in the volleyball league that I am in.

<b> What belief of the offender led to this injustice?</b>
She seems to believe that the physical differences between male and female anatomy is so large that segregation is fine.

<b> What is it about our society that allows this to happen?</b>
Some people are sexist to other people and treat it like nothing, as if it was an every day occurrence that is completely acceptable.

### Judge
<b> Why is this unjust? (or what makes this action unjust?)</b>
This unjust because while it is anatomically proven that males are stronger than females, we should still all be treated equally as the strength of a person has many various factors, allowing women to still be stronger than men.

<b> How do the circumstances affect the situation?</b>
The circumstances don't affect the situation much at all. It's volleyball which everyone can do with proper technique and practice. Volleyball is a sport where although helpful, strength isn't a required thing.

<b> What principles apply? What can help us choose our own response to this issue?</b>

<b> How does our Christian faith guide us to act?</b>
Our faith tells us to treat everyone equally, regardless of race, age, sex, etc. Therefore, the actions of the person in question are wrong.

<b> How do the principles shown in the Good Samaritan come into play?</b>


### Act
<b>What can I do?</b>
I can inform the woman that many of us have voiced concerns about her sexist remarks.

<b>How will I do it?</b>
At the end of the practice, I can inform her accordingly, also asking her to reflect on her words, further advising her to think out her future comments, finally warning her of consequences if her negative remarks are made again.

### Evaluate
<b> Does my/our action help correct the injustice?</b>
Possibly. She could consider my words to her and adjust her actions accordingly, or take it completely in the opposite direction.

<b> Was my/our action compassionate?</b>
I believe so. I looked at the whole picture including other people and other options and decided that this action was the best action moving forward.

<b> What else, or what more, could I/we have done?</b>
Apart from waiting it out, we could have boycotted her as a coach, informed her superiors about her actions, etc.

# Theme 2: How Much is Enough?
<b>Why were Karla, Lynne, and Allen uncomfortable when they visited Ricardo?  Would you have been uncomfortable if you were them?</b>
They were uncomfortable because the situation that Ricardo is in, does not reflect with the work he does in the church and his commitments to helping others.

<b>Karla and Allen think that Ricardo and his family should be uncomfortable with their wealth.  Do you agree?  Why or why not?</b>
I disagree. I feel that they probably had to work hard to get to the wealthy position that they are in. Therefore, they should be comfortable and be able to enjoy their wealth. However, Ricardo should be giving more back to the people around him who are less fortunate than him.

<b>Lynne thinks that Ricardo’s situation is not that different from her own.  Could you say the same thing? Why or why not?</b>
I believe so. What Lynne said was completely true. However, it's different because here in Canada, those are just part of the standard. Most people have those things if not more. However, in El Salvador, our standard is probably very rich to them.

<b>Should the story of Lazarus and the rich man make us uncomfortable?  Why or why not?</b>
I believe that while it shouldn't make us uncomfortable, it should cause some unrest. The story shows us what could happen to us if we don't share our graces with people who are less fortunate than us.

## The Preferential Option for the Poor
> 

<b>What is Jesus’ challenge to us about material possessions?</b>
Jesus challenges us to share aout possesions but primarily with the poor.

<b>Explain the reference to getting a camel through the eye of a needle.</b>
The reference of fitting a camel through the eye of a needle is basically saying it's humanly impossible. But as it reads after the reference, it says that it's impossible without God's help.

<b>Why does it take a lifetime to be as just as we can be?</b>
It takes a lifetime because something could change, causing you to become unjust. Therefore, it takes a lifetime because you have to be just for the whole period rather than just the time you have lived thus far.

<b>How is solidarity with the poor solidarity with God?</b>
As stated, God has a special love for the poor. Therefore, by taking care of the poor, you are indirectly taking care of God at the same time.

<b>How can we say that God loves everybody and that God has a special love for the poor?</b>
We can confidentally say that God loves everybody because if he dislikes certain people he would have done something to eliminate them or at least hinder their path in life.

> 

<b>What does Matthew mean by “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”?</b>
I believe that Matthew means that it's better to protect yourself rather than your possesions as God will grant you these treasures in heaven.

<b>Can a person be wealthy and serve God?</b>
Partially. If they are wealthy and share most if not all of their wealth with people who are less fortunate, than I believe that they can truly serve God. However, if they are wealthy and show no intent of helping the less fortunate out, than I believe that they are not serving God.

>

<b>Can we love God without loving even “the least” of the people we encounter?</b>
I personally don't believe so. Loving God also involves loving your neighbours. By not loving your neighbours, indirectly, you aren't loving God.

<b>How is this reading challenging?  How is it comforting?</b>
I find it challenging that the world works in that way. In a way where people still have to ask for help rather than people than giving it. Obviously, there are scenarios where simply helping isn't possible but there's only a small number of scenarios where that can happen.

<<<<<<< HEAD:Grade 9/Semester 1/Week 2/HRE1O3-01/Unit 7 - Be Just.md
# Theme 3: How Can the Earth Survive?
<b>How would you explain Natural Law?</b>
Natural Law is the balance and order that God intended for the Earth when he created it.

<b>What does protecting the environment have to do with our relationship with God?</b>
Protecting the environment also protects the balance and order that God wanted for the Earth. By protecting the said balance and order, you are doing God's work which will improve your relationship with him.

<b>Can a person who mistreats the environment be considered just? Why or why not?</b>
Situationally. Sometimes, a person has to harm the environment for the common good. In that case, if all other options were considered and the best option was chosen, I believe that that person can be called just.

>

<b>Explain the relationship between God and the diversity of creation.</b>
 God decided that there should be balance in the world but to have balance there has to be variety. That's why God created diversity. He created different plants, animals, water types, clouds, skies, etc. He created there so that there was something to be balanced.
 
<b>What does it mean for human beings to "have dominion", that is, "to rule"?</b>
When God created the Earth, he created us human beings to be the smartest animal out of all the animals. So naturally, we as the superior beings would have dominion and rule over the world.

<b>Who are the meek in the world today? How are they working to save our planet from destruction?</b>
Simple people like you and me. As we each do our part, we slowly help the Earth return to its original form. Government officials. As they create new laws and regulations which will create a huge difference as we try to keep our planet as healthy as possible.

<b>List 3 negative impacts that you have on the Earth and 3 corresponding ways you could be a better steward of the environment.
    1. Large carbon footprint. Use more efficient ways of travel.
    2. Don't always put stuff in the right bins. Find the proper bin rather than just using the garbage.
    3. I throw things away when they start to show wear. I could try to repair them or utilize them for some thing else.
=======
>

<b>What is generosity?</b>
Generosity is being liberal in giving. Generosity is giving to people as much as you can no matter the situation.

#Unit 7 Evaluation Task
---

All of us here at Mary Ward are very fortunate to be here. As a self-directed learning 

centre, being 1 of 6 in the country, the opportunities we will have as a result could be 

larger than if we had attended other schools. However, some people are less fortunate 

than we are. Some don't get a chance to attend a school like Ward, some have a chance 

but don't take it or use it to their fullest. And lastly, some don't have a change at all. 

Sometimes, it's simply impossible for God to give everyone a equal chance. That's where

we as people of God come in. Luckily, we have been blessed to be more fortunate than 

others. God calls us to give to people who are less fortunate than us. But you may ask 

yourself, why should I? God calls us to give up our possessions to the poor in return for a 

place in heaven. He also tells us that joining in solidarity with the poor is the equivelant 

of being in solidarity with God-self. Therefore, by helping out people less fortunate than 

us, we are also indirectly helping God and helping ourselves. Onwards, all creating 

belongs to God. Regardless of who, what, where, when, or why, it all belongs to God. By 

keeping an unequal piece of creation, not only are you doing a disservice to yourself but 

also a disservice to God. God created the world with the intent of people living in piece 

equally. However, generations of sin and other factors have caused a great imbalance. 

Helping out the poor helps fix this imbalance, hopefully helping us reach a point soon 

where everyone is equal again. Moving on, it mentions in the book that true peace 

cannot be reached until the basic needs of all people are met. By helping out the poor, 

you are slowly helping the world return to true peace. God created this Earth with the 

intention that everyone lives equally. Where there is no poor or no rich. However, we 

have reached a point in our existance where that has happened. Now we must work to 

regain that balance again. By helping out the people less fortunate than ourselves, we 

are slowly regaining that balance.
